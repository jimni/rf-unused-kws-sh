# rf-unused-kws-sh
shell script for finding unused keywords in Robot Framework project

#Usage

Implementation is raw and might fail from time to time, so dont ever use this thing on production or anywhere near 

The `folder_path` is the path to your RF project

After specifying the path just run the script and watch stdout

Script has no way of working with Keywords that use embedded variables, sorry %(. Contributions are very welcome
